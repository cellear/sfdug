# SFDUG Brand Guide

## Voice

SFDUG speaks like a respected colleague — technically fluent, professionally confident, and genuinely invested in the craft. Not corporate, not casual. The voice of someone who's been building with Drupal for years and still finds it interesting.

**We are:**
- **Direct** — We say what we mean without hedging or hype
- **Knowledgeable** — We assume competence in our audience
- **Collegial** — Peer-to-peer, not instructor-to-student
- **Substantive** — We lead with content, not community platitudes

**We avoid:**
- Meetup-speak ("hanging out," "grabbing beers," "come say hi")
- Breathless enthusiasm ("exciting," "amazing," "incredible")
- Vague community language ("connect with like-minded people")
- Self-deprecation or underselling

**Tone calibration:**
More like a well-run conference track than a local meetup. More like A List Apart than a Discord server. Technical credibility first, warmth second.

## Core Messaging

These are the ideas that should come through in everything we publish:

### 1. This is where serious Drupal work gets discussed.
SFDUG sessions feature working professionals solving real problems. The people presenting here are the same people speaking at DrupalCon, contributing to core, and architecting enterprise implementations.

### 2. Sessions are produced, not just hosted.
Every session is recorded with broadcast-quality production. Slides are clear. Audio is clean. The result is content worth publishing — to YouTube, to podcast feeds, to your team's Slack channel.

### 3. Speakers are prepared, and so is the audience.
Topic notes go out in advance. Attendees submit questions beforehand. The Q&A is structured. This isn't a free-for-all — it's a format that respects everyone's time and produces better conversations.

### 4. We're part of something larger.
SFDUG is closely connected to BADCamp and the broader Bay Area Drupal ecosystem. What happens here feeds into the regional and global Drupal community.

## About SFDUG (Revised)

The San Francisco Drupal Users Group hosts monthly sessions on Drupal development, site building, and the broader web ecosystem. We've been running for nearly twenty years — first in conference rooms and co-working spaces around the city, now online and accessible everywhere.

### What to expect

Each session runs 45 minutes, featuring a single speaker on a focused topic. Sessions are recorded and published to YouTube and podcast feeds. Production quality matters to us: clear audio, readable slides, and content worth revisiting.

Speakers submit topic notes in advance. Attendees can review the material and submit questions before the session begins. Q&A is structured — written questions first, then open discussion with moderation to keep things on track.

We meet virtually on the third Thursday of each month.

### Who speaks here

Our speakers are working professionals: developers, architects, and specialists who build with Drupal every day. Many have presented at DrupalCon, contribute to Drupal core, or lead major projects in the enterprise and nonprofit sectors. Appearing at SFDUG is an opportunity to share expertise with an engaged, technically sophisticated audience — and to have that work captured in a format worth sharing.

### Who this is for

SFDUG is for people who work with Drupal professionally and want to keep getting better at it. You don't need to be an expert to attend, but you should be interested in substance over socializing. If you're looking for a casual hangout, this probably isn't it. If you're looking for well-prepared content from people who know what they're talking about, you're in the right place.

### Our history

SFDUG has operated continuously since the mid-2000s, making it one of the longest-running Drupal user groups in the world. Over the years we've covered the full arc of Drupal's evolution — from Drupal 5 through the current generation, from monolithic builds to decoupled architectures, from FTP deployments to modern DevOps workflows. Our archive includes sessions on Backdrop CMS, accessibility and WCAG compliance, migrations, performance, theming, Layout Builder, Composer, and dozens of other topics.

### BADCamp connection

SFDUG is part of the Bay Area Drupal community that produces BADCamp, the annual Bay Area Drupal Camp. Many of our organizers and speakers are also BADCamp contributors, and the two groups share a commitment to high-quality technical content and community development.
