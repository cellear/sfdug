20 years of Bay Area Drupal. A new format for the next 20.

## Body

In April 2006, Zack Rosen and Gregory Heller organized the first Drupal Camp SF — a two-day training that sold out in five days and launched a community that's been meeting ever since.

Twenty years later, we're still here. New format: 45-minute sessions, recorded and published, with structured Q&A and production values worth your time.

First session features **Matt Glaman** — Drupal core contributor, author, and maintainer of projects you depend on.

Third Thursdays, online. Launching spring 2025.

# Alt version (legacy emphasis)

**San Francisco Drupal Users Group**

**Est. April 2006**

The Bay Area Drupal community has been gathering for twenty years — since Zack Rosen and Gregory Heller organized the first Drupal Camp SF at Compumentor's offices, with Jeff Robbins from Lullabot as the trainer.

We're relaunching with a new format built for the next twenty: monthly sessions, 45 minutes each, recorded and published with broadcast-quality production. Speakers submit notes in advance. Attendees submit questions beforehand. Q&A is structured.

This isn't a casual meetup. It's a venue for serious Drupal work.

**First session: Matt Glaman**
**Schedule: Third Thursdays, online**
**20th anniversary: April 2026**
