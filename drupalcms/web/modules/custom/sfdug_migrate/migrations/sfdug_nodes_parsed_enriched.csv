<p>Presentation:<br/>
DevOps for frontend developers (who can't backend good and wanna learn to understand other stuff good, too) with Tearyne Almendariz, Developer Advocate at Pantheon</p>
<p>""As a front-end web developer, the first leg of Tearyne Almendariz's career focused heavily on the user interaction layer - analyzing user experiences and designing and coding user interfaces. When she joined her first large scale production team, there were a lot of tasks in the realm of DevOps with which she found herself very unfamiliar.</p>
<p>She was lucky to have many senior and full-stack developers mentor and assist her along the way, and with this talk she aims to help others to similarly level up their DevOps knowledge and skillsets.</p>
<p>In this talk, you can expect to:<br/>
- learn the lingo and key principles of DevOps - what is a trunk? What happened to branches? What are secrets (and how do we keep them)?<br/>
- learn about different DevOps workflows and what workflows work best for different types of projects<br/>
- deepen your understanding of how interacting with larger scale development workflows impact the structure of your code<br/>
- learn about the power of scripting - an invaluable process that will help you become a powerful collaborator while keeping your time focused and protected from excessive tinkering""</p>
<p>About the speaker:<br/>
Tearyne D. Almendariz's passion for all things Japan and Sailor Moon led her to become a front-end developer with a focus on accessibility and usability. She has designed, prototyped, and coded user interfaces and worked on teams small and large. One time she even converted Coldfusion sites to React Apps -- and lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p>If you ever have installed Drupal in any language other than English, you have already downloaded translations from Localize, the Drupal community translation server (localize.drupal.org). It is a collaborative tool where contributors from various linguistic and cultural communities coordinate their efforts to get Drupal core and contrib projects translated.</p>
<p>With the upcoming release of Drupal 10, a group of volunteers gathered in Ghent in April 2022 and initiated the port of this major Drupal community tool from Drupal 7 to Drupal 9. Let's dive together into its current status.</p>

7:00 - 7:30 pm: Wrap up, more hanging out and chatting up Drupal</p>
<p>Presentation:<br/>
Optimize your images to make your site load faster</p>
<p>Your site speed is a crucial element of good UX, and an important part of technical SEO efforts. We often think of optimizing Drupal's speed in terms of accelerating the page rendering, but often the speed of Drupal sites is hurt even more by requiring visitors to download much bigger image files than are truly necessary.</p>
<p>In this session we'll review effective strategies to make your image files a fraction of their current size, and the core and contrib modules needed.</p>
<p>About the speaker:</p>
<p>Martin Anderson-Clutz, Solutions Engineer at Acquia started his Drupal journey in 2005, with version 4.6. Since then, his passion for the community has been shown in his frequent participation at Drupal user groups, local Drupalcamps, and Drupalcons, often as a speaker. He was with Digital Echidna (now a Northern company) from 2015 to 2021, and recently joined Acquia as a Solutions Engineer.</p>
<p>He also maintains a number of contrib modules, including Smart Date, Search Overrides, and a few others.</p>

5:45 - 7:30: Speaker Workshop</p>
<p>Presentation:<br/>
Speaker Workshop</p>
<p>This workshop helps speakers from underrepresented groups prepare to speak at conferences. This will in turn help local meetups, Drupal Camps, and even DrupalCons develop a more diverse speaker roster. The workshop helps folks bust through their impostor syndrome and develop a topic, title, pitch, and outline.</p>
<p>The workshop covers:<br/>
 - Impostor syndrome<br/>
 - Finding a topic<br/>
 - Better speaker tips<br/>
 - Writing a great pitch<br/>
 - Creating an outline<br/>
 - Creating great slides<br/>
 - Public speaking confidence</p>
<p>This workshop is a great fit for you if you’ve ever felt uncomfortable about speaking at events or wanted to present but found yourself thinking:<br/>
 - “What would I talk about?”<br/>
 - “I’m not an expert in anything.”</p>

<p>Presentation:<br/>
Drupal Views by Example<br/>
One Drupal's most powerful features, and a major differentiator over other CMSs, is Views. They are a flexible and dynamic way to list of information on your site. That can be nodes, users, comments, taxonomy terms, files, and more.</p>
<p>Views scan your website using any criteria you specify and present the results in the format of your choice. For example, a HTML table, a RSS feed, a PDF document, a CSV document, an interactive map, an image slideshow, or a JSON representation to be used as a REST endpoint.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will present examples of common use cases for Views. Along the way, you will learn how to work with the Views UI. You will also leverage other Drupal site building concepts to create custom content listings.</p>
<p>About the speaker:<br/>

Captchas and other gotchas: Make sure your secure website is accessible with AmyJune HineLine, Senior Community manager at Opensource.com</p>
<p>Security measures and accessibility don’t always play nice, and you may be inadvertently leaving some of your content consumers behind. Captchas, timed logins, alert pop-ups, gated content, and modals are often used for security but not all assistive technology can get their users past the barriers.</p>
<p>Fun with custom migrate source plugins</p>
<p>Sometimes you need a source plugin that doesn’t exist to migrate content in the way you want. Extending contributed and core source plugins can be surprisingly easy and fun.</p>
<p>About the speakers:<br/>
AmyJune Hineline (volkswagenchick) is an active contributor in the Drupal community and other open source projects and has a dual focus on both open-source community development and inclusivity. She currently works as Senior Community manager at Opensource.com and was the recipient of the 2021 Aaron Winborn Award.</p>

ECA (Event - Condition - Action): New rules engine for Drupal 9+ with Jürgen Haas, Founder of the Drupal User Group Lake Constance<br/>
Inspired by BPMN (<a href=""http://www.bpmn.org"" title=""www.bpmn.org"">www.bpmn.org</a>) and a customer's requirement to migrate from Drupal 7 to 9 for sites with extensive use of rules, we investigated possible ways forward and built a proof of concept for a brand-new engine in Drupal 9 to process events based on BPMN models. Turned out to be more than a PoC and turned into a set of modules publicly available on drupal.org - this presentation will demonstrate this in action and explain the architecture behind it.</p>
<p>About the speaker:<br/>
Jürgen Haas has been a Drupal enthusiast since version 4.7 and a passionate contributor for modules, documentation, patches, and support in the issue queue. Working full-time on Drupal solutions with a focus on backend development and automation/devops. Founder of the Drupal User Group Lake Constance in 2011 and a regular speaker at meetups and a couple of times on DrupalCon too.</p>

<p>Presentation: Stupendous Date Tricks with Martin Anderson-Clutz, Solutions Engineer at Acquia<br/>
Managing dates and times is often complex: recurring events, timezones, daylight savings times, regional formatting conventions, and more. Add in additional presentation requirements like add-to-calendar links, registration links, and related content (like agendas, that change for each date instance), and the complexity can seem bewildering.</p>
<p>Fortunately Drupal offers a rich toolset for solving these challenges. In this session, we'll explore the solutions, not only showing how they work but also detailing the modules and the configuration needed.</p>
<p>About the speaker:<br/>
Martin Anderson-Clutz, Solutions Engineer at Acquia started his Drupal journey in 2005, with version 4.6. Since then, his passion for the community has been shown in his frequent participation at Drupal user groups, local Drupalcamps, and Drupalcons, often as a speaker. He was with Digital Echidna (now a Northern company) from 2015 to 2021, and recently joined Acquia as a Solutions Engineer.<br/>
He also maintains a number of contrib modules, including Smart Date, Search Overrides, and a few others.</p>

<p>Presentation: Designing 'With' &amp; Not 'For,' rootid's Evolving Project Process Journey<br/>
Design work and website builds are fraught with power and identity dynamics. Too often the design and build processes do not center the needs of those most impacted by its outcomes. Since 2019, rootid has been standardizing all of our processes in alignment—deepening and reframing our work as partnerships 'with' versus designing 'for.'</p>
<p>This session will share our journey, warts and all, as well as some of the techniques we use to make continual space to notice and reflect upon how power, identity and oppression show up in varying contexts of our work.</p>
<p>About the speaker:<br/>
Val Neumark, Director of strategy &amp; education, founder of rootid, is a brand strategist, educator, facilitator and coach focused on using communications, design-thinking and technology as vehicles to advance equity. Through partnerships and collaborations, endeavoring to co-design anti-racist, anti-oppressive spaces and tools that facilitate strategic-thinking, community building and sustainable growth for non-profits and social impact organizations.</p>

<p>Presentation: Accessible Slideshows - Button, button, who's got the button?<br/>
Arguably, the first rule of slideshows is to not have slideshows, but what do you do when the primary stakeholder insists…</p>
<p>According to W3 schools: “Carousels are disputed from a usability perspective because their content can be hard to discover. Ensuring accessibility can also improve usability.”</p>
<p>Together we’ll follow Alice down the rabbit hole and learn about the different types of slideshows (often called carousels), discuss their components, and dive into how to make our slideshow accessible across different types of users and user agents.</p>

<p>Presentation: Understanding React.js<br/>
React.js has become one of the top players in the JavaScript libraries world. Drupal is planning to adopt the library to create admin interfaces. WordPress has rebuilt its WYSIWYG editor using React.</p>
<p>This session aims to explain the basic concepts of React outside of the context of any particular CMS implementation. Throughout the presentation, a static site will be converted into a dynamic React application. Along the way, you will learn about different concepts and the process of working with React. Many examples will be presented to help you understand it works and why it is so powerful.</p>
<p>No previous experience with React.js is required. Basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax suffices.</p>

<p>Drupal Diversity &amp; Inclusion advocates through SFDUG are hosting a Speaker Diversity Workshop to help speakers from underrepresented groups prepare to speak at conferences. This will in turn help local meetups, Drupal Camps, and even DrupalCons develop a more diverse speaker roster. The workshop helps folks bust through their impostor syndrome and develop a topic, title, pitch, bio, and outline. #DrupalSpeakerDiversity</p>
<p>The workshop covers:<br/>
- Impostor syndrome<br/>
- Finding a topic<br/>
- Better speaker tips<br/>
- Writing a great pitch<br/>
- Creating an outline<br/>
- Creating great slides<br/>
- Public speaking confidence</p>
<p>This workshop is a great fit for you if you’ve ever felt uncomfortable about speaking at events or wanted to present but found yourself thinking:<br/>
- “What would I talk about?”<br/>
- “I’m not an expert in anything.”</p>
<p>Trainer(s): AmyJune Hineline (volkswagenchick)</p>
<p>Registration is now open and we would love to see you attend. If you’re from a marginalized or underrepresented group and have felt challenges around speaking at events, these workshops will help you to venture out with your first talk, or, if you’ve spoken before, to level up your skills and confidence.</p>
<p>If you feel as if you’ve had some tension around speaking due to an aspect of your identity that is underrepresented or marginalized in the Drupal community, we would love to see you at our Speaker Diversity Workshop.</p>

<p>Presentation: Boosting Layout Builder Under the Hood<br/>
This talk presents a case study for how Oomph supported the Rhode Island School of Design's spring art show, which was hosted entirely online in June 2020. There was already an existing custom digital platform that had been created for the RISD Museum that relied heavily on Layout Builder from Drupal core. Building on that, the codebase was extended to support the entire undergraduate and graduate student body as well as editor and admin roles for staff. Additional custom features were added to Layout Builder to allow artists a lot more control, creativity, and flexibility over theming their digital projects.</p>

<p>4:50 pm PT: Views cookbook - advanced recipes for every web occasion with Anna Mykhailova, Senior Drupal Architect at Kalamuna<br/>
Have you ever wondered how to get the most out of the Views, how to go beyond standard config? Have you ever been confused about Views build cycle, hooks and plugins? This session is going to demystify all of the components, clear the instructions and set you up with the ""ingredients"" for Views recipes that are suitable for every occasion.</p>
<p>5:30 pm PT: Get Off the Island: What We Can Learn From Craft CMS, Contentful, SquareSpace, and WordPress with Suzanne Dergacheva, co-founder of Evolving Web<br/>
Creating a great content editor experience is key to Drupal’s success and to the success of every Drupal website. But to build an intuitive interface for content editors, we need to understand content editors’ expectations and what experience other CMSs are offering. In this session, I’ll demo findings of a study of CMS user experience. We’ll look at Craft CMS, Contentful, SquareSpace, and WordPress. Learn what these platforms do right, and what we can learn as Drupal site builders, developers, and contributors.</p>
<p>6:10 pm PT: Manually Curated Solr Search Results with Martin Anderson-Clutz<br/>
Drupal has a mature and robust integration with Apache Solr for enterprise-quality site search. That said, some competing search solutions give editors the ability to manually curate results for popular searches. You'll see how the module is installed and configured, and how easy it is to promote content and manage results, even right from the node form. We'll also discuss the different configuration options, and how they influence the results that will be returned.</p>
<p>6:30: JSON:API: 101 Understanding JSON:API in Drupal with Parvateesam Konapala, Solutions Engineer at Pegasystems<br/>
The JSON:API module is a fully compliant implementation of the JSON:API Specification. The JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability.</p>
<p>7:05: Teams: joining efforts to maintain projects with Marco Villegas, contractor at adapt<br/>
Open source benefits from community collaboration a lot, in the form of<br/>
contributions of different types, but how sustainable they are may depend on the amount of people around them.<br/>
This presentation explores the idea of team maintainership in the Drupal<br/>
community, looking also at some experiences in other open source projects.</p>

<p>Presentation: Be a Smarter Drupal Super Hero! - Choosing your Coding Charity-Cases Wisely...</p>
<p>Back in the early days of Drupal, it was common for new students to take on ""mandatory-volunteerism"" - building websites for friends, families, and charity groups, to hone their skills in agile and coding, and try their hand at team/agency &amp; freelance site build work. Over the years, as students and charities have come and gone; how can those remaining and dedicated Drupal Super Heroes and faithful Drupal-Community Fans now do a better job at maintaining those professional-relationships (and relic-sites)? How can we continue building (or re-building) on the co-beneficial aspects of pro-bono volunteers' and non-profit administrators' Business-to-Business collaborations? Are there actually ways to ""cash-in"" on charitable coding, site building, and hosting for budget-poor organizations? Attend this casual interactive chat (and former Drupal Super-Hero's therapy session) / informal presentation to find out an awesome answer!.</p>
<p>About the speaker:<br/>
Eileen Callejas is the Founder of Helpertunity.org, and a ""Coding for a Cause / Camp Code Sprit Day"" Charity Site-Build Survivor. She believes that Drupal is a Community, as much as it is a Code/CMS tool, (...which is why she keeps coming back to be with the Drupal People, no matter how little she understands about the Drupal product she uses to maintain her charity's unique small site!)</p>

<p>Description:<br/>
In this talk, Danny will show us how to get up and running with the default content module. Default content is a way of staging content via version control so that it appears in remote environments upon deploy. Here are a few of the many things you can do with this module.<br/>
- Capture all kinds of entities into default content including composite entities such as paragraphs.<br/>
- Capture custom blocks into code<br/>
- Capture images and files into code<br/>
- Setup an entire landing page with content locally and have it magically appear in a remote enviroment<br/>
He'll show us how to setup a custom module for our default content and give a demo with a step-by-step process on how to make this work.</p>

<p>Presentation: Drupal Recipes</p>
<p>Don't you wish you had a site-building recipe book when you started out using Drupal? There are many great blog posts, training resources and tutorials already available to the Drupal community. The Fox Valley Drupal User group, in conjunction with other Drupal user groups, are coming together to create a collection of site-building recipes for core and contributed modules.</p>
<p>Drupal Recipes is a user group driven initiative to contribute to Drupal Community Documentation for site owners, managers and builders. Recipes can help everyone learn because Drupal is still complex and hard to understand. Our intent is not to duplicate, but rather enhance and collect the ""best of"" examples and keep them updated. As recipes are verified and deemed complete, we plan to add them to the documentation at Drupal.org.</p>
<p>Our desire is to encourage more participation to help save everyone - new and seasoned users - future pain and suffering in their Drupal journey. Drupal Recipes is an initiative of the Fox Valley Drupal user group.</p>

<p>Presentation: Responsive Images Demystified<br/>
Even to an experienced site builder, responsive images might seem like a bit of a mystery. There are multiple ways to configure them and it's not really clear how and when to use them.</p>
<p>In this presentation, you will learn how to set up responsive image styles in Drupal using core modules (Media + Breakpoint + Responsive Image). We'll break down the different configuration options and see how they translate to code. As a bonus, we'll look at how to use Image Widget Crop module to apply different crop settings at different break points.</p>

<p>Presentation: Taking Maximum Advantage of Drupal Core's Composer Template<br/>
If you're looking to build a modern Drupal 8 or 9 site, then you're probably going to want to use the Drupal core Composer ""recommended-project"" template. Debuting with Drupal 8.8, this modern, (officially) community-supported Composer template gets your project off on the right foot.</p>
<p>This session will both deconstruct and provide examples, tips, and tricks for making the most of the drupal/recommended-project template. We will compare and contrast it with the ""Drupal Composer / Drupal Project"" template, and introduce some additional dependencies to help manage your project's codebase effectively.</p>

<p>Best practices for Integrating components with Drupal<br/>
Building reusable components in a design system such as Pattern Lab is only half the job. The second half is to seamlessly integrate those components with Drupal. There are several approaches to accomplishing this in a Drupal 8 website, in this short workshop I will walk you through integrating components using the Presenter Template approach while adhering to Drupal's best practices for caching, render arrays and performance. We will make use of Twig's template suggestions, ensure our components provide mechanisms for leveraging Drupal's attributes, title_prefix, and title_suffix. By the end of this workshop, you will have a component fully integrated and rendered in Drupal with a single source of truth for markup, styles, and JavaScript, all coming from Pattern Lab.</p>

<p>Presentation: Live Captioning: Make your next event accessible for everyone<br/>
Live Captioning makes events more accessible for people with disabilities using voice to text. It helps reach an even wider audience once the event is over by providing transcripts for videos and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) value for event sites.</p>
<p>Voice to text technology continues to improve every year. We are now able to share our thoughts in real-time with an entire room of people using tools that capture speech into text. But did you know that live captions have benefits in addition to accessibility that allows you to reach an even wider audience?</p>
<p>The Live Captioning Initiative, first and foremost, helps hearing-impaired individuals follow along and participate at events in real-time. However, live captioning also benefits multicultural audiences whose first language is different from the language being spoken or comprehend written word better. It helps people understand speakers with different voices and accents in many group situations and helps make your event more accessible by enabling access for people with hidden disabilities.</p>

<p>Static Analysis for your Drupal modules with CI<br/>
Do you read your code before running to make sure it would work? Do you see if that variable was initialized, or if you included a return statement? Do you also see if the code follows Drupal coding standard? If you answered yes to any of the above, you are statically analyzing your code in your head.</p>
<p>But your brain doesn’t scale, nor are you capable of checking hundreds of lines of code with every commit. Use your brain for better things and leave static analysis to tools designed for that purpose.</p>
<p>You might have used PAReview for your Drupal modules to verify that your code is clean and follows coding standards. It is easy to forget to run it before each commit. Do yourself and the poor soul who has to review your merge request a favor and automate!</p>

Hussain Abbas has been working with Drupal for about a decade and contributing for about 7 years. He has had the privilege of traveling to several Drupal events worldwide and speaking at almost all of them. His day job is mostly supporting his team via mentorship or management, but often gets into code writing an occasional Drupal module, developer tools, integrations, or just about anything where he can write code.</p>

Drupal 8 and 9 Migrations by Example<br/>
Starting with Drupal 8, the Migrate API makes it possible to write and execute migrations without having to write PHP code. It is also possible to execute them from the Drupal administration interface if the command line is not available or you prefer not to use it.</p>
<p>This session will explain the Migrate API and many of its concepts like source, process, and destination plugins from a site builder perspective. Subfields, constants, pesude-fields, the process pipeline will also be explained. You will also learn about the migrate ecosystem to be aware of what tools are at your disposal. The examples include migrating from CSV and JSON files to populate different field types like taxonomy, date, image, file, and address.</p>
<p>=&gt; Learning Objectives<br/>
* Learn to run migrations from the user interface.<br/>
* Understand different Migrate API concepts.<br/>
* Import data from CSV and JSON files.<br/>
* Transform the data to populate taxonomy, date, image, file, and address fields.</p>
<p>=&gt; Target Audience<br/>
People who want to learn about the workflow and thought process to migrate data into Drupal 8/9. Site builders will learn how to perform migrations. Project managers will understand the complexity of these tasks for better estimation.<br/>
Prerequisites</p>
<p>Although no prior Migrate module knowledge is required, it is expected that attendees have a basic understanding of site building concepts like nodes, content types, and fields. You can have a look at this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02fvLzPSIjc"" title=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02fvLzPSIjc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02fvLzPSIjc</a> for an overview of the Drupal site building concepts.</p>

<p>Websites are typically the largest marketing tool an organization has, and yet few organizations have the budget to fully redo a site every few years. It’s critical to create a site that can sustain you for the long-term, and it can be done! We'll share tips on how to improve the longevity of your site, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay strategic: keep your eye on setting realistic, smart goals.</li>
<li>Stay nimble: launch one thing at a time: test, launch, and iterate!</li>
<li>Create a strong foundation: create a program around website health, including having the right team of humans in addition to the right goals and tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this session, we’ll go in-depth on those items, plus discuss other ways to ensure the longevity of your site so your budget can be put to the best use to maintain a long-lasting site. This session is good for anyone who is in charge of building or maintaining your organization’s website. So basically everyone who internally comes in contact with your site!</p>

* 7:30 -</p>
<p>Layout Builder components can break your site. Here's how.<br/>
There are several types of components you can make and use with Layout Builder. This session will explain why certain component types will break critical features of Drupal, including page revisioning, Workflow and Workspaces—and possibly more features if they depend on any sort of revisioning.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? These features are not yet ready to handle certain component types and may not handle complex data structures in your custom components. These complex data structures may be as simple as a parent-child relationship in a slide carousel.</p>
<p>If you aren't careful, features you or your customer thought would work, won't.<br/>
The types of components we will examine are Custom Global Blocks, Custom Inline Blocks, Content Field Blocks, and Programmatic or System Blocks. We will review both Internally Revisioned and Externally Revisioned components and will study both simple and complex component data structures.</p>
<p>Even if you are not making custom components, site designers, site builders and developers should be familiar with the pitfalls presented here to ensure critical Drupal features don't break while they explore the wonderful new world of Layout Builder.</p>

<p>Accessible Media<br/>
Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services. If you’re in charge of your website, you have a lot of things to cover between keeping it up to date, entering and managing content, and making sure it's all accessible.</p>
<p>As part of an inclusive content strategy, how accessible is your media?</p>
<p>We'll do a deep dive into making your media more accessible. We'll cover definitions, standards, guidelines, as well as images, videos, captions, media players, and more.</p>
<p>About the speaker:<br/>

<p>Moving from Drupal 7 to Backdrop CMS<br/>
You have a perfectly good Drupal 7 site that does everything you need<br/>
it to do, but Drupal 7 is nearing its end-of life. If you haven't<br/>
considered moving to Backdrop CMS, you may be surprised to learn that<br/>
Backdrop could be your most affordable option -- especially if you've<br/>
invested heavily in custom code. Come watch a live upgrade (not a<br/>
migration) of a Drupal 7 website to Backdrop CMS. You'll get a chance<br/>
to experience everything that is familiar after the upgrade, and see<br/>
some of the areas that have been improved. We'll also cover some of<br/>
the similarities and differences between the Drupal and Backdrop<br/>
communities.</p>
<p>About the speaker:<br/>
Jennifer Lea Lampton has been building websites since 1997, and participating in open-source communities since 2006. She maintains several Open Source projects, and contributes fixes to many others projects as it relates to the needs of her work.</p>
<p>Jen Lampton has been a very active member in the Drupal Open Source community for over a decade.</p>
<p>Backdrop is the Drupal fork. It stands between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 including features comparable to Drupal 8 with the familiar code style of Drupal 7, but with an increased focus on usability and performance. Backdrop removes complexity that only benefits the 1%, making the whole system a better fit for the 99%.</p>
<p>As Drupal becomes the tool of choice for the enterprise, Backdrop emerges for everyone else. With a focus on simplicity and affordability, Backdrop CMS fills the widening gap between Drupal and WordPress.</p>

<p>Your Code is Terrible!<br/>
New Developers have forgotten the importance of semantic HTML code and how they can create better user experiences and make websites more accessible utilizing it.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will explain the importance of semantic code, how to use it, and why it's so important to understand as developers. We’ll explore adding tools to our toolbox that help us create semantic code in Drupal and methods to test code for accessibility compliance.</p>

<p>Start Using the Emerging Layout Builder Ecosystem</p>
<p>After years of preparation and work, Layout Builder has landed in core and it promises a new way to make pages in Drupal. Will Layout Builder take over from the long pedigrees of Display Suite, Panels and other page layout systems? Is it already on the way to doing that?</p>
<p>In this session, we will describe how we used Layout Builder on a major new Drupal 8 site and will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's currently available in Layout Builder</li>
<li>What's coming next in core, look at what we really want to see next</li>
<li>The existing modules that provide functionality not yet in Layout Builder</li>
<li>Some of the new contributed Layout Builder Components you can use on your sites</li>
<li>Some gotchas when working with it, particularly with multilingual sites</li>
<li>How to use Layout Builder effectively depending on the type of page you are creating</li>
<li>When you leave this information-packed presentation, you'll be right up to date with Layout Builder and ready to make decisions on how to use it on both large and small sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>Composer in Core Initiative: What it will mean for you</p>
<p>Drupal has leveraged Composer to manage its internal dependencies since version 8.0; however, the ""Drupal way"" of using Composer has been a little bit different than what is typically done in other Composer-based projects. To this day, many Drupal sites ignore Composer entirely, using Drupal-specific services such as Drush pm-update to download code from bespoke services provided by drupal.org.</p>
<p>Currently, there is an active initiative to change the relationship between Drupal and Composer to more closely align with the facilities provided by the standard Composer APIs. At the August SFDUG meeting, Greg Anderson will give an overview of what has been happening in the Composer In Core initiative, and how the changes slated for Drupal 8.8.0 will affect new and existing Drupal 8 sites. We will talk about drupal-composer/drupal-project, the Drupal Scaffold plugin, the Wikimedia Composer Merge plugin, subtree splits, Composer ""path"" repositories, and other gripping topics.</p>
<p>After attending this meetup, users will have a clearer understanding of the vision for Composer use in Drupal core, and what their options are for using Composer with their own sites moving forward.</p>

<p>You spent the last 6 months of your life building and launching a site. Now the client is asking: “How are my KPIs performing?” Maybe you have already installed Google Analytics or maybe you just did a few “Drupal Google Analytics” searches. Either way, implementing the basics of Google Analytics, is a breeze. The trouble is that it does not give you enough information. You know how many people are going and where, but not what they are actually doing on the site, how far they are scrolling, how many white papers they downloaded and etc.</p>
<p>In this talk, Vadim will:<br/>
 - Explain why we need to start tracking our sites with more granularity; pageviews and sessions are just scratching the surface.<br/>
 - Help you understand the difference between page and event metrics.<br/>
 - Provide recommendations as to which Drupal modules most cleanly integrate with google analytics.<br/>
 - Show you how to save hours setting up GTM via automation with gtmbot.io.<br/>
 - Illustrate how GTM can be used to setup any 3rd party script. Empower marketing teams and save dev time!<br/>
 - Provide examples of how to setup goals and filters within Google Analytics.<br/>
 - Use a Chrome extension, dataSlayer, to debug and ensure all your data is being sent to the right places.</p>

<h2>Everybody has something to contribute</h2>
<p>Drupal is made possible by a very diverse group of people around the globe using a huge variety of skills including but not limited to user experience design, project management, development, planning, testing, bug reporting, performance analysis, integration, triage, event organization, marketing, session recording, photography, translations, book authoring, and the list goes on and on. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translators — Are you good in a written language other than English? We need you!</li>
<li>Content Strategists — Want to work on reorganizing the documentation and improving the content quality? We need you!</li>
<li>Project Managers — You want to bring forward certain initiatives and know how to build a team with different expert skill sets and how to facilitate the progress? We need you!</li>
<li>Marketeers — You have ideas for advancing the promotion of Drupal and need a team? And you are good at sharing your strategy insights? We need you too!</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is just for starters! If you have ideas on how to contribute, participate in our contribution opportunities.</p>

<h3>“Sprint” vs. “contribution”</h3>
<p>Please note that this type of events has been called “sprint” or “code sprint” in the past. For the sake of inclusivity (contributions can relate to more than code, avoid the notion of any required speed) the Drupal community decided in 2018 to speak of “contributions” instead. You will still find the old labels here and there, don’t let this confuse you.</p>
<p><a id=""dgcw-host"" name=""dgcw-host""></a></p>
<h2>Participate as a host</h2>
<p>No events announced that are close to you? Why don’t you host one!<br/>
This is a brilliant opportunity to actually let more people contribute to Drupal. Don’t worry, it’s super easy and it’s a contribution in itself. “Resources to help plan your event” section will give all the info you need. When you are ready, go to the upcoming event’s detail page and simply add your event in the list. You will find detailed instructions on the respective page.</p>

<h3>Announce your event location</h3>
<p>Some blurbs to add to your session/event description (edit to fit your event):</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone is welcome; if you have built a site in Drupal, you can contribute. We will split into groups and work on Drupal core issues. Bring your laptop. For new folks: you can get a head start also by making an account on Drupal.org, getting some <a href=""https://www.drupal.org/dev-env"">contribution tools</a>, and developers can install git before coming and git clone Drupal 8 core.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Contributors of all skill levels and experiences welcome! Just bring your laptop, together we'll find something for you to work on.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Participate as a contributor</h2>
<p>If you ever wondered, how to start giving something back to the community, this is your chance. Visit the upcoming contribution weekend's page. If there is a location within your reach, we strongly recommend you announce that you're coming (use the register link on the details page), pack your laptop computer and join a friendly group of people, always ready to get new contributors on board.</p>
<p>If there is no contribution location within your reach, look out for links to ""virtual meetups"". If no option available, you can still invite a friend or two and just organize yourselves or use one of the general communication channels to find like-minded people for your own virtual contribution meetup on a topic of your choice.</p>

<h3>Ressources to help plan your contributions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://drupal.org/list-changes/drupal"">Drupal 8 change notifications</a></li>
<li>Resources for contributed module developers: <a href=""https://www.drupal.org/update/modules/7/8"">upgrading your modules to Drupal 8</a>. Look at git logs and 8.x issues from <a href=""https://www.drupal.org/project/contrib_tracker"">modules that have already started a 8.x branch</a>. As you port, first commit a 7.x version as initial 8.x, and make frequent public commits (and issues in your issue queue!). In those commit messages: 1) say what you did, *and* 2) add ""per ...."" and site the change record, or link to an example in another module that led you to think that was what needed to be done. The ""per"" is really useful. See also the <a href=""https://drupal.org/project/pants"">Pants</a> example module. </li>
<li>Use IRC, and post a comment when about to work on an issue.</li>

<p>Building fast websites is surprisingly straight forward - building them with Drupal is less-so.</p>
<p>In this talk I cover modern performance techniques, and how to go about accomplishing them with Drupal. I provide real world examples of these techniques, and easy ways of using them on any Drupal project.</p>
<p>Topics include:</p>
<p>Performance measurement tools</p>
<p>The critical path and how to optimize for it</p>
<p>Responsive Images</p>
<p>SVG icons</p>
<p>Cutting the Mustard</p>

<p>As the concept of “progressive decoupling” gains traction in the Drupal community, existing use cases where such implementations have proven their value can be instrumental in guiding our path forward. Weather.com is a perfect example of a scenario where a large Drupal site had to balance the needs of performance, maintainability and innovation, while providing tools that would allow both content editors and developers to move rapidly and independently.</p>
<p>Out of this balancing act was born what has been called at various times “Angularmodules”, the “Presentation Framework”, and now, “Client Side Panels”. The premise is straightforward: create a system where front-end developers can write piece of functionality in their framework of choice (for weather.com, this was Angular 1) without having to know anything about Drupal’s APIs. Next, allow those pieces of functionality to be ingested by Drupal into panels content types in such a way that content editors can simply drag and drop them into new pages and layouts.</p>
<p>Now, with Weather Underground being migrated onto the platform built for weather.com, this system is being generalized to allow for their use of the forthcoming Angular 2 framework instead of Angular 1. This paves the way for a truly front-end-framework agnostic system that would give the same performance and editorial benefits while allowing front end teams to use whatever framework is the hot thing of the day.</p>
<p>This session will explain how and why all of this came to pass, the lessons learned, and ultimately begin to lay the roadmap for building this system to be framework agnostic from the ground up as a Drupal 8 contrib module</p>

<p>Jesus Manuel Olivas <a href=""https://github.com/jmolivas"" title=""https://github.com/jmolivas"">https://github.com/jmolivas</a> creator and lead developer of the Drupal Console project will be presenting.</p>
<p>The Drupal Console is a suite of tools that you run on a command line interface (CLI) to generate boilerplate code and interact with a Drupal 8 installation.</p>
<p>Drupal Console is another cool addition to the Proudly Invented Elsewhere school of thought as it leverages the Symfony Console component to handle the CLI part.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is provide a tool easy to use for everyone, from developers currently using Drupal 8 and those who are planning to learn.</p>
<p>Drupal 8 is more technically advanced compared to its predecessor. Writing a module involves a lot of boilerplate code. There are also a lot of things you need to know and do just to get started building a new module. These tasks can be repetitive and tedious and can therefore create opportunities for errors. Fortunately, a lot of the new code can be generated automatically using Drupal Console.</p>
<p>During this session, attendees will learn:</p>
<p>What is the Drupal Console?.</p>
<p>Why should you care about Drupal Console?</p>
<p>How to install and use Drupal Console.</p>
<p>How to develop integrations for Drupal Console (custom commands for contrib modules).</p>
<p>How to contribute to Drupal Console.</p>
<p>How to use Drupal Console to learn Drupal 8.</p>
<p>Following the session we will do a live demo of how to create your own plugin for console.</p>

<p>Come to New Relic to hear Nica Lorber Chapter Three's creative director share her tips for maintaining the quality of your new site after launch.<br/>
Nothing is worse than delivering a sparkling new site full of promise and seeing it ruined with crappy content. The best designed sites can be wrecked with blurry imagery, TLDR* copy, and incorrect use of styles.</p>
<p>In this session, I’ll cover factors that contribute to crappy content implementation and the steps we can take to avoid them. I will share deliverables that close the gap between site launch and maintenance.</p>
<p>I will cover:</p>
<p>• Teaching clients to write for the web</p>
<p>•  Improving usability through editing</p>
<p>• Creating flexible layouts.</p>
<p>• Creating content guidelines unique to your Drupal site's architecture</p>
<p>• Creating guidelines for responsive sites</p>

<p>The Drupal Rewind (okay, call it a Fork): Backdrop</p>
<p>What's the deal with Backdrop CMS, the fork of Drupal?</p>
<p>Many community members have been showing increasing levels of concern with the architectural direction of Drupal 8. Between large-scale conversions, rewritten foundations, multiple external libraries, and the increased level of abstraction, Drupal 8 is shaping up to be the biggest architectural shift in Drupal's history.</p>
<p>Recently, the concern around these changes reached the tipping point, and a fork of Drupal was officially announced, called Backdrop CMS.</p>
<p>Come join the ""founding forkers"" Nate Haug (""quicksketch"") and Jen Lampton (""jenlampton"") at SFDUG to have your questions about Backdrop answered.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A fork is a tremendous undertaking, why couldn't Drupal 8 just be ""fixed"" with all this effort?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is Backdrop differentiating itself from Drupal 8? How are they trying to be the same?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are forks good or bad? How could Backdrop benefit Drupal, and how could it be damaging?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When is Backdrop going to be ready for production?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is development happening and why would you be interested in participating?</p>

<p>Drupal 8 has a new theme engine: Twig. Twig provides several advantages over PHPtemplate, our previous theme engine, including: Security, Performance (probably), and Ease of Use.</p>
<p>In this session We'll point out some of the problems we faced with PHPTemplate and Renderables, and show how these issues are being addressed through the move to Twig. There's still a lot to do, and some things we still haven't decided on yet, but we're definitely making progress.</p>

<p>Topic<br/>
Entities in Drupal 7 &amp; the Entity API</p>
<p>Synopsis<br/>
With every major version of Drupal comes a wealth of improvements. Some of these are easily visible to site administrators and end users, while others are more ""under the hood"". The concept of entities, introduced in Drupal 7, is definitely an ""under the hood"" improvement: one that offers Drupal developers a new set of tools to build web applications more quickly and help ensure scalability and performance.</p>
<p>In this interactive talk, we'll:</p>
<pre><code>Compare data storage options in Drupal 6 to those in Drupal 7 (there are more in Drupal 7!)
Explore what entities are and how they relate to nodes, content types, users, taxonomies, fields, bundles, and more
Walk through defining a custom entity
Discuss how to leverage the Entity API contrib module to take full advantage of entities including integration with Views, Rules, and more
Look at examples of entities in action
</code></pre><p>We'll start at a high-level (suitable for site builders) and finish looking at some code examples.</p>
