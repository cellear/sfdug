## Body

In April 2006, Zack Rosen and Gregory Heller organized the first Drupal Camp SF — a two-day training at Compumentor's offices with Jeff Robbins from Lullabot. It sold out in five days. Half the attendees flew in from out of state.

That was the beginning.

Since then, the Bay Area Drupal community has gathered hundreds of times — at Pantheon, at Chapter Three, at UCSF, online, and everywhere in between. We've talked about Drupal 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and everything that came with each release. We watched the Backdrop fork happen. We've celebrated launches, survived migrations, and helped each other ship.

**April 2026 marks 20 years.**

We're relaunching SFDUG with a new format. More soon.
