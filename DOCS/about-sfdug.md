# About SFDUG

For nearly two decades, the San Francisco Drupal Users Group has been the Bay Area's premier gathering place for Drupal developers, site builders, designers, content strategists, and digital professionals. Since our founding, we've brought together the local Drupal community to share knowledge, solve problems, and build lasting connections.

## What We've Done

SFDUG has hosted regular meetups featuring presentations, workshops, roundtable discussions, and hands-on sessions covering the full spectrum of Drupal development and site building. Our topics have included:

- **Modern Development Practices** – Decoupled architectures, JSON:API, headless Drupal, Git workflows, and deployment strategies
- **AI and Emerging Technologies** – Integrating LLMs and AI capabilities into Drupal sites
- **Site Building Excellence** – Content architecture, multilingual implementations, responsive design, and Layout Builder
- **Developer Tools and Workflows** – Local development environments, hosting platforms, configuration management, and DevOps practices
- **Accessibility and Standards** – WCAG compliance, inclusive design, and best practices for accessible web experiences
- **Community and Contribution** – How to contribute to Drupal core and contributed modules, mentoring new contributors, and participating in global sprint events
- **Career and Professional Development** – Hiring practices, freelancing strategies, and navigating the Drupal job market

## Our Community

SFDUG welcomes everyone from curious newcomers to seasoned Drupal architects. Whether you're building your first site or architecting enterprise solutions, you'll find peers who understand your challenges and celebrate your successes. We've featured presentations from Drupal core contributors, project leads, and local practitioners who bring real-world experience to every discussion.

## Meeting Format

Our gatherings have typically included:
- Featured presentations by community members and special guests
